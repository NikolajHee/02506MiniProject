# 02506MiniProject
A PyTorch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the data 'Segmentation of neuronal structures in EM stacks1'



# Ideas for direction
- Transfer learning, to utiliez informaiton learned from other datasets
- Splitting the images up in smaller images, such that we get more data
- data augmentation (mirroring, turning, )
- Sliding frame (creating an training image for each movement of the frame)
